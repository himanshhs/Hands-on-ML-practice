# Hands-On Machine Learning – Practice Repository

This repository contains my personal implementations, experiments, and notes
while learning Machine Learning concepts inspired by the book  
**Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow**.

The goal of this repository is to:
- Build end-to-end machine learning pipelines
- Experiment with models and preprocessing techniques
- Understand concepts through implementation rather than theory alone
- Create placement-ready proof of skill development

## Current Progress
- Chapter 2: End-to-End Machine Learning Project (In Progress)

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- NumPy, Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab

> Note: All notebooks are written and modified by me as part of my learning and experimentation process.
